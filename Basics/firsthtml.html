	<H1>What is Front-End Web Development</H1>
	<p>You can categorize website development into two areas: front end and back end. The front end is what you see on the screen — menus, graphics, and other features. You’ll also see the front end called client-side because that’s who is interacting with it. Front-end developers are primarily responsible for the site’s appearance.</p>

    <p>Back-end developers work behind the scenes on the server-side of a website. They use various programming languages to make things happen, whether it’s going to a thank-you webpage for signing up for a newsletter or adding contact information to a database. Their work focuses on a site’s functionality.</p>

    <p>A full-stack developer is a jack of all trades. They can work both ends of web development, with proficiency in a wide range of programming languages. As you may expect, most of the people working with application programming interfaces (APIs) work in this role. All three types of developers work with the user experience but use different programming languages.</p>

    <h2>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h2>

    <p>The foundation of all web development starts with HyperText Markup Language (HTML). It uses a standardized system of markup or tags that provides the recipe for how text, images, and other elements will appear on a webpage.</p>
